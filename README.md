# Credit-Risk-Modelling

Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will not be able to make timely payments and will default on their debt. It refers to the possibility that a lender may not get the interest or principle due to them on time.

Financial organisations are concerned about reducing the risk of default. As a result, commercial and investment banks, venture capital funds, asset management organisations, and insurance corporations, to mention a few, are increasingly depending on technology to anticipate which customers are most likely to default on their obligations.

Machine Learning models have helped these companies in improving the accuracy of their credit risk analysis by giving a scientific technique for predicting potential debtors.

We are going to model the probability of a person defaulting a loan.

First: Exploratory Data Analysis

Then: Data Visualization

Finally: Modelling using SMOTE to counter the imbalance in the data. Use of Logistic Regression; Random Forest Classifier; XGBoost Classifier; LightGBM; CatBoost and Support Vector Machines Classifier. Then hyperparameters fine-tuning using RandomizedSearch with 5-fold cross-validation over XGBoost and CatBoost.

We get an accuracy of 82% with XGBoost fine-tuned.
